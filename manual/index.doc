\mainpage TMON: UM TOPIC MONITOR

\n \section overview Overview

The "tmon" package is an API wrapper around the Ultra Messaging library which
provides topic-level event monitoring.
This is intended to work along with the standard UM "automatic monitoring".

Users must add calls to the tmon API to their applications at specific points.

The rest of this page provides a high-level description of the tmon package.

\n \section sourcecode Source Code

The "tmon" package is provided in source code form at
[Ultra Messaging GitHub](https://github.com/UltraMessaging).

Note that tmon is not officially part of the UM product family.
This implementation of tmon should be considered "example" code,
to be incorporated into the user's application and modified to meet
the user's individual requirements.
If those modifications are reasonably general in nature,
the user is invited to submit "pull" requests on GitHub.
Informatica will review the proposed changes and will usually accept the
pull request, incorporating the improvements.

Additionally, Informatica is committed to fixing bugs.
Please raise issues using the normal GitHub issue tracking functionality,
or through the normal Informatica support organization.

In other words, although tmon is not officially part of the UM product family,
Informatical intends to support it.
However, we don't currently plan to include tmon as part of the product package.

Finally, be aware that that:

* Informatica does not include tmon in its QA testing.
Note however that tmon includes a reasonably extensive automated self-test.

* Informatica does not guarantee that future UM development will
be compatible with tmon.

Naturally, the amount of effort we invest in tmon will be proportional to
the level of user interest.
If you decide to use tmon, please let us know through the support organization!
We will keep you informed of the package's continued evolution.

<ul>
<li>TBD
</ul>


\n \section opportunitiesandlimitations Opportunities and Limitations

<ul>
<li>Because UM automatic monitoring does not give the application access
to the internal monitoring context,
tmon must create its own context.
This adds an additional context and thread to each application.

<li>TBD
