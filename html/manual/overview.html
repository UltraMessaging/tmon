<div class="textblock"><p>The "tmon" package is an API wrapper around the Ultra Messaging library which provides topic-level event monitoring. This is intended to work along with the standard UM "automatic monitoring".</p>
<p>Users must add calls to the tmon API to their applications at specific points.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="suppliedassourcecode"></a>
Supplied as Source Code</h1>
<p>The "tmon" package is provided in source code form at the <a href="https://github.com/UltraMessaging">Ultra Messaging GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Note that tmon is not officially part of the UM product family. This implementation of tmon should be considered "example" code, to be incorporated into the user's application and modified to meet the user's individual requirements. If those modifications are reasonably general in nature, the user is invited to submit "pull" requests on GitHub. Informatica will review the proposed changes and will usually accept the pull request, incorporating the improvements.</p>
<p>Additionally, Informatica is committed to fixing bugs. Please raise issues using the normal GitHub issue tracking functionality, or through the normal Informatica support organization.</p>
<p>In other words, although tmon is not officially part of the UM product family, Informatical intends to support it. However, we don't currently plan to include tmon as part of the product package.</p>
<p>Finally, be aware that that: </p><ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">Informatica does not include tmon in its QA testing. Note however that tmon includes a reasonably extensive automated self-test.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
Informatica does not guarantee that future UM development will be compatible with tmon. </li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, the amount of effort we invest in tmon will be proportional to the level of user interest. If you decide to use tmon, please let us know through the support organization! We will keep you informed of the package's continued evolution.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="features"></a>
Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">Provide information by which a centralized monitoring tool can detect connectivity problems such as deafness or loss.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
Provide information to identify the producers and consumers of topics. </li>
</ul>
<p>The primary focus of tmon is on applications. The application calls tmon APIs to inform the monitoring tool of important events, like creation of sources and receivers, as well as important events in a receiver's life cycle.</p>
<p>The expectation is that users will write their own monitoring tool that receives these events, as well as UM's traditional automatic monitoring data, to track the health of their sources and receivers. This package does not contain sophisticated monitoring and tracking functionality. Only a simple example is provided that just prints the events and monitoring data. It is the user's responsibilty to write the code required to draw conclusions from the data.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="examplemonitoringtool"></a>
Example Monitoring Tool</h1>
<p>The supplied example monitoring tool, "lbmtmon.c", is derived from the standard UM example monitoring tool, <a href="https://ultramessaging.github.io/currdoc/doc/example/lbmmon.c">"lbmmon.c"</a> (one of the <a href="https://ultramessaging.github.io/currdoc/doc/example/index.html">C example apps</a>).</p>
<p>The "tmon.c" module is primarily focused on the user's applications, but does contain a few APIs intended for use by the monitoring tool. The purpose is to be able to conform to the standard UM monitoring software "transport options" string.</p>
<p>See <a class="elRef" doxygen="/Users/sford/Documents/GitHub/tmon/html/c.tag:../c/" href="../c/tmon_8h.html#ab09d9c9ed73960a763b4fdd1b55fbc35">tmon_create_context()</a> and <a class="elRef" doxygen="/Users/sford/Documents/GitHub/tmon/html/c.tag:../c/" href="../c/tmon_8h.html#a1040837000444f89cd161168df0f872e">tmon_create_monrcv()</a>.</p>

 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="customization"></a>
Customization</h1>
<p>As mentioned in the <a class="el" href="overview.html">Overview</a>, Informatica's expectation is that users will modify the tmon package for their own needs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="limitationsandopportunities"></a>
Limitations and Opportunities</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">Because UM automatic monitoring does not give the application access to the internal monitoring context, tmon must create its own context. This adds an additional context and thread to each application.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The simple design of tmon makes it less scalable than a more complex design could be. In particular, it may not be suited for applications that create many thousands of source or receivers in rapid succession. A potential enhancement might be a work queue that is rate limited.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Currently only a C version is available. Production of Java and/or .NET versions will depend on demand.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The supplied example monitoring tool just prints the received events, nothing more. There are a lot of interesting things that could be added. For example, it could raise alarms if a publisher creates a source but subscribers for that topic do not discover or connect within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">There is no query capability. For example, if the monitoring tool is not collecting data for a period of time, perhaps due to network failure, events reported during that time are lost. A potential enhancement might be a query to the application's tmon. It could respond with full lists of sources and receivers and their states.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
With wildcard receivers, it is not possible to know what topic is active when a connection object is created. It is not until the BOS or EOS event that the topic is known for that connection. (With regular receivers, the topic is known when the receiver is created.) </li>
