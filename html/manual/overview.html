<div class="textblock"><p>The "tmon" package is an API wrapper around the Ultra Messaging library that provides topic-level event monitoring. This is intended to work along with the standard UM "automatic monitoring".</p>
<p>Users must add calls to the tmon API to their applications at specific points.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="suppliedassourcecode"></a>
Supplied as Source Code</h1>
<p>The "tmon" package is provided in source code form at the <a href="https://github.com/UltraMessaging">Ultra Messaging GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Note that tmon is not officially part of the UM product family. This implementation of tmon should be considered "example" code, to be incorporated into users' application and modified to meet each user's local requirements. If those modifications are reasonably general, the user is invited to submit "pull" requests on GitHub. Informatica will review the proposed changes and will usually accept the pull request, incorporating the improvements.</p>
<p>Additionally, Informatica is committed to fixing bugs. Please raise issues using the standard GitHub issue tracking functionality, or through the normal Informatica support organization.</p>
<p>In other words, although tmon is not officially part of the UM product family, Informatical intends to support it. However, we don't currently plan to include tmon as part of the product package.</p>
<p>Finally, be aware that: </p><ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">Informatica does not include tmon in its QA testing. Note, however, that tmon includes a basic automated self-test.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
Informatica does not guarantee that future UM development will be compatible with tmon. </li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, the amount of effort we invest in tmon will be proportional to the level of user interest. If you decide to use tmon, please let us know through the support organization! We will keep you informed of the package's continued evolution.</p>
<p><br />
 </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="features"></a>
Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">Provide information by which a centralized monitoring tool can detect connectivity problems such as deafness or loss.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
Provide information to identify the producers and consumers of topics. </li>
</ul>
<p>The primary focus of the tmon package is on applications. The application calls tmon APIs to inform the monitoring tool of significant events, like the creation of sources and receivers, as well as important events in a receiver's life cycle.</p>
<p>Tmon's event-driven approach is different from the standard UM automatic monitoring approach where satistical data is accumulated and reported periodically. Tmon reports individual events on timeframes driven by the occurrence of those events. The intent is that both forms of monitoring data are valuable to the successful operation and troubleshooting of a UM network.</p>
<p>The expectation is that users will write their own monitoring tools that receives these events, as well as UM's traditional automatic monitoring data, to track the health of their sources and receivers. This package does not contain sophisticated monitoring and tracking functionality. Only a simple example tool is provided that prints the tmon events and traditional UM monitoring data. It is the user's responsibility to write the code required to draw conclusions from the data. </p>
